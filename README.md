# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

The overview of the project is to make the code more efficient. Refactoring is a key part of the coding process; refractoring doesn't add any new process or functionality, it merely makes the code more efficient. We are comparing the refractored code times vs the original run times.

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to compare the original code run time to the refractored code run time. By adding a ticker index, we are grouping the tickers all together and running the code through it once, rather than individually. 

## The analysis is well described with screenshots and code

In this image, the difference between the two codes is the introduction of the tickerindex. The index allows the code to run through the entire index once, allowing for a quicker run time.

In this image, we can compare 2018 refract to the original code. The code was 19 x more efficient.

In this image, we can compare 2017  refract to the original code. The code was 29 x more efficient. 

### There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general

The advantage of running refractored code is quicker and more efficient run time, easier to read, less complex and easier to understand. The disadvantage of refractored code is the time spent simplifying it.

### There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script.
The advantage of the original script is that it is easier to write than the refractored code(IMO) and easier to read. I found the refractored code mroe challeneging to understand. At first, I didn't understand why we needed to create a ticker index, but after examining the logic and reason behind it, it makes sense. The code ran more efficiently after refractoring. The advantage of refractoring is the ability to analyze greater amounts of data quicker, faster and cleaner.
